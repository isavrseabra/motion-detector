**Visual Neuroscience Final Project: Motion Detector**

The files in this repository are python notebooks for the basic motion detector code and the direction tracking code. 

In both folders, you have the code and the videos that I used. In both codes, you can easily change the video being used by changing the file that is being declared as the argument. 

A quick summary of both codes:

**basic motion detector:** this program analyzes a video in a frame by frame maner and compares them in order to detect whether or not there has been movement. 

**direction movement tracker:** this program uses a similar approach (frame by frame comparison) in order to determine in which direction the object is moving.
